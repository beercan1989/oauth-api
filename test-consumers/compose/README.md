# Compose
This will be a compose multiplatform application that utilises a public client to get a user.  

Its a separate project from the main OAuth one so that the dependencies don't clash with the main application.  

Thinking of trying to cover:
* Android
* Desktop
* Website (WASM)

Probably not going to cover:
* iOS - due to needing specialised hardware and software to compile code.
